# Task-1-Portfolio-Website

Welcome to my **Static Portfolio Website** project! This portfolio showcases my work, skills, and experience as a web developer. The website includes a homepage, a "Projects" section (with placeholders), and a contact form with JavaScript validation. I used **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** (with optional use of **Tailwind CSS** for styling) to create this project, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- **Homepage**: An introductory section that presents who I am and what I do as a web developer.
- **Projects Section**: A section where placeholders for future projects are displayed.
- **Contact Form**: A fully functional form with JavaScript validation to ensure only valid submissions.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be fully responsive and looks great on all devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- **Services Section**: Highlights my key services as a web developer, including web design and development.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS**: For custom styling and making the website visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For form validation and adding interactivity to the website.
- **Tailwind CSS** (optional): For fast and responsive styling.
